.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Run \f[V]CMD\f[R] every time one of \f[V]FILE(s)\f[R] is written to.
.PP
\f[V]FILE(s)\f[R]: A comma, space, or newline separated list of files
\f[B]or\f[R] a \f[V]FILESPEC\f[R].
See FILESPEC below.
.PP
\f[V]CMD\f[R]: Command to run when an event happens.
Inside \f[V]CMD\f[R], occurrences of \f[V]%\[ha]\f[R] are expanded to
the whole list of files and \f[V]%\f[R]:

\f[C]
iwatch my_script.py \[aq]python3 %\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If \f[V]CMD\f[R] is long running the previous run of \f[V]CMD\f[R] is
sent the \f[V]TERM\f[R] signal and a new run is started when an event
happens.
.SH FILESPEC
.PP
If the \f[V]FILE\f[R] argument starts with \f[V]\[at]<path>\f[R], then
\f[V]iwatch\f[R] will watch all files tracked by git \f[V]<path>\f[R]
relative to PWD (even if <path> starts with a \[aq]/\[aq]) and for
\f[V]\[at]:<path>\f[R]
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
\f[V]CMD\f[R] is run whenever certain events happen to the watched files
so not exactly when the file is written to.
Other events are ignored like opening the file which happens very
frequently if we have an LSP running.

.SH LORE
.PP
Even though I started this using \f[V]fswatch\f[R] on MacOS, I thought
MacOS had inodes which is why I called it \f[V]iwatch\f[R].
This was a long time ago :).
