iwatch FILES CMD
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run \f[CR]CMD\f[R] every time one of \f[CR]FILE(s)\f[R] is written to.
.PP
\f[CR]FILE(s)\f[R]: A comma, space, or newline separated list of files.
.PP
\f[CR]CMD\f[R]: Command to run when an event happens.
.PP
If \f[CR]CMD\f[R] is long running the previous run of \f[CR]CMD\f[R] is
sent the \f[CR]TERM\f[R] signal and a new run is started when an event
happens.
.SH CAVEATS
\f[CR]CMD\f[R] is run whenever certain events happen to the watched
files so not exactly when the file is written to.
Other events are ignored like opening the file which happens very
frequently if we have an LSP running.

.SH LORE
Even though I started this using \f[CR]fswatch\f[R] on MacOS, I thought
MacOS had inodes which is why I called it \f[CR]iwatch\f[R].
This was a long time ago :).
