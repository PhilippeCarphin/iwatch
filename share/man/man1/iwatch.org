#+TITLE: iwatch

* NAME

#+begin_src
iwatch
#+end_src

* SYNOPSIS

#+begin_src
iwatch FILES CMD
#+end_src

* DESCRIPTION

Run =CMD= every time one of =FILE(s)= is written to.

=FILE(s)=: A comma, space, or newline separated list of files.

=CMD=: Command to run when an event happens.

If =CMD= is long running the previous run of =CMD= is sent the =TERM=
signal and a new run is started when an event happens.

* CAVEATS

=CMD= is run whenever certain events happen to the watched files so not
exactly when the file is written to.  Other events are ignored like
opening the file which happens very frequently if we have an LSP
running.

* BUGS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

Please submit an issue on [[https://github.com/philippecarphin/iwatch]] or
submit a merge request with any improvements.

* LORE

Even though I started this using =fswatch= on MacOS, I thought MacOS had
inodes which is why I called it =iwatch=.  This was a long time ago :).
