.EX
iwatch \-\-filespec FILESPEC \-\-cmd CMD [\-\-recursive]
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run \f[CR]CMD\f[R] every time one of \f[CR]FILESPEC\f[R] is written to.
.PP
\f[CR]FILESPEC\f[R]: A comma, space, or newline separated list of files.
.PP
\f[CR]CMD\f[R]: Command to run when an event happens.
.PP
If \f[CR]CMD\f[R] is long running the previous run of \f[CR]CMD\f[R] is
sent the \f[CR]TERM\f[R] signal and a new run is started when an event
happens.
.SH CAVEATS
\f[CR]CMD\f[R] is run whenever certain events happen to the watched
files so not exactly when the file is written to.
Other events are ignored like opening the file which happens very
frequently if we have an LSP running.

.SH LORE
The p is for Python.
I only wrote that version in 2025 because I wanted to see if it was
going to be easy.
It turned out to be a bit more difficult because I had to use threads
and flags to make the threads stop.
Still fun though.
.PP
It turns out that this is still useful because it\[aq]s easier to pip
install watchdog than to get fswatch or inotify\-tools (although if
you\[aq]re on MacOS, you probably own it and can brew install things).
